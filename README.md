# Hacker's Handbook

This site is a handbook for hacking and penetration testing. Iâ€™ve written it mainly for my own learning, but thought if I find it useful, then others might too.

The topics are not meant to go in to any sort of depth but the content will act as a reference if you are hacking in a lab and need access to a quick reference on how to do something.

# Google

Google can be a powerful tool in conducting research against a target. In addition to the regular search query that everybody does, you can narrow down your focus by using some of the operators it supports.

## Operator Reference

| Operator | Example | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `site` | `site:bbc.co.uk` | Filters results that only appear on `bbc.co.uk` |
